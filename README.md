## Purpose of Website

The purpose of this website is to display my skills and interests to prospective employers and recruiters. It includes pictures of me as well as a showcase of my past work as well as links to my social media accounts.

## Functionality/Features 

The website has been fully optimized for desktop, tablet and mobile using media queries and will resize accordingly when acessed on different devices. My html documents are syntactically valid and have been layed out semantically for clarity. Stlying of each element have been clearly defined in all my CSS style sheets.

For my portfolio website I have chosen to implement a simple black and white theme. This ensures that my element and content in white contrast well against the background image which is predominantly black. 

My navigation bar and links use a cyan border when hovered which stands out as it is the only css style that is colour and will appear when hovered over using the mouse pointer. This will optimize user experience and ease of access within the site. 

The Website features 5 pages with a navigation bar at the top of every page and a copyright text inside the footer. 

**Home** -  Features the hero image as well as a short introduction about myself. 

**About Me** - Features 2 images of me displayed side by side and a long description about myself including my previous line of work, current study and hobbies. Below this is an icon that when clicked will open up a seperate document containing my resume in pdf format.

**Portfolio** - Features 4 photographs of my past work in separate div containers. 

**Blog** - This page lists 5 example blog posts, including images annd seperated by article containers. 

**Contact Me** - This page features a blurb which asks the viewer to contact me via the social media icons below.
