## Purpose of Website

The purpose of this website is to display my skills and interests to prospective employers and recruiters. It includes pictures of me as well as a showcase of my past work as well as links to my social media accounts.

## Functionality/Features 

This website has been fully optimized for desktop, tablet and mobile using media queries and will resize accordingly when acessed on different devices. My html documents are syntactically valid and have been layed out semantically for clarity. Stlying of each element have been clearly defined in all my CSS style sheets.

For my portfolio website I have chosen to implement a simple black and white theme. This ensures that my element and content in white contrast well against the background image which is predominantly black. 

My navigation bar and links use a cyan border when hovered which stands out as it is the only css style that is colour and will appear when hovered over using the mouse pointer. This will optimize user experience and ease of access within the site.
